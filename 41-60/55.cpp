/*55. Write a program in C++ to enter P, T, R and calculate Compound Interest.
Sample Output:
Calculate the Compound Interest :
-------------------------------------
Input the Principle: 20000
Input the Rate of Interest: 10
Input the Time: 1.5
The Interest after compounded for the amount 20000 for 1.5 years @ 10
% is: 3073.8 The total amount after compounded for the amount 20000 for 1.5 years @
10 % is: 23073.8*/
