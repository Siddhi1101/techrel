/*52. Write a program in C++ to enter two angles of a triangle and find the third angle.
Sample Output:
Find the third angle of a triangle :
-----------------------------------------
Input the 1st angle of the triangle : 35
Input the 2nd angle of the triangle : 35
The 3rd of the triangle is : 110 */
